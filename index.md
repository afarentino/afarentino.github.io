<b>Summary:</b> Talk given in 2015 to paint the architectural vision for a zero-downtime blue-green deployment environment -- based on Continuous Delivery best practices.  This work paved the way for a 10-month project that incrementally transformed this vision into a reality for Curriculum Pathways.

<b>Summary:</b> "Pitch deck" for my very first "[Dolphin Tank](https://www.canopy.space/dolphin-tank-san-francisco-social-impact/)" product idea.  While this idea was never pursued, we did not have the domain-knowledge in-house needed, it served as a great learning opportunity.  

I continued to pitch innovative product ideas in this forum -- think of it as a softer version of the popular US TV series [Shark Tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Tank).

### Toastmasters Talks

<b>Summary:</b> Presented at the District 37 Toastmasters Leadership Institute conference.  Audience members were fellow VP's and talented speakers at their clubs. 

During the mastermind session, participants break out into small groups dedicated to a Key To Club Success. After writing down their best ideas on a large poster board, each group had 2 minutes to share their discoveries with the rest of the class.

</div>    
<b>Summary:</b> The Icebreaker is the first talk a member gives when they join a Toastmasters club. This speech allowed the club to learn more about me. It also set the foundation for my ongoing interest in captivating audiences with not only great content but stunning visuals.

The Facebook profile page served as inspiration for Prezi's starter template.

<b>Summary:</b> Talk encouraging SoftTalk Toastmasters to signup and participate in a SAS volunteer led [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us).  After watching, several viewers accepted my challenge to help bridge the gap. To this day, several still remain active volunteers.

[How to Say It: Super Green Egg Cups](https://prezi.com/view/FlFa7QiHCkqoku3xkWUf)

</div>  
<b>Summary:</b> The objective of this speech was to use vivid descriptive words that allow the audience to "see" the selected topic come to life in their minds. Recreating this recipe with my added "tasty tips" certainly accomplished that! Audience members wanted to taste these egg cups that I still prepare at times for breakfast.

</div>  
<b>Summary:</b> This workshop was presented to members of the [NC Project Managemenent Institute](https://ncpmi.org/). It was delivered as a brainstorming session similar to the Toastmaster's Leadership conference talk shared above.  

During the workshop, John and I challenged project leaders to embrace simple yet effective habits that reduce cognitive load and increase team effectiveness.

### Mindmaps
Mindmapping products like [Mindmeister](https://mindmeister.com) provide another dimension for anyone to create, present, and share ideas.  

I use mind mapping to help with book reviews, training materials, meeting agendas, and as a tool for discovery work.  One of my favorite features of Mindmeister is its support for publishing maps as traditional slide shows. If you want to give the product a try, here is a [link](https://www.mindmeister.com/mind-map-pricing) to Mindmeister's pricing.  All users can sign-up for FREE and create up to 3 maps.
