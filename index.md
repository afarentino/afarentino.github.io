<b>Summary:</b> Presented at the District 37 Toastmasters Leadership Institute conference.  Audience members were all VP's and talented speakers at their own clubs. 

To help draw on their expertise, particpants were split into groups focused on one of the main Keys to Club Success. After writing down their best ideas on a large white poster board, each group had 2 minutes to share their discoveries with the rest of the class.

<b>Summary:</b> The Icebreaker is the first talk a member gives when they join a new Toastmasters club. This speech allowed the club learn more about me. It also set the foundation for my ongoing interest in capturing audiences with not only great content but stunning visuals.

This Prezi template was inspired by the Facebook profile page.


[How to Say It: Super Green Egg Cups](https://prezi.com/view/FlFa7QiHCkqoku3xkWUf)

</div>  
<b>Summary:</b> The objective of this speech was to use vivid descriptive words that allow the audience to "see" the selected topic come to life in their minds. Recreating this recipe with my added "tasty tips" certainly accomplished that! Audience members wanted to taste these egg cups that I still prepare at times for breakfast.
