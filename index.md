### Toastmasters Talks 

Talks in this collection helped me earn the Competent Communicator (CC) and Competent Leader (CL) designation's from Toastmasters International.

Presented at the District 37 Toastmasters Leadership Institute conference.  Audience members were all VP's and talented speakers at their own clubs. 

To help draw on their expertise, particpants were split into groups focused on one of the main Keys to Club Success. After writing down their best ideas on a large white poster board, each group had 2 minutes to share their discoveries with the rest of the class. 

The very first talk I gave as a member of Toastmasters. It set the foundation for my interest in using tools like [Prezi](https://prezi.com) that allow a speaker to create engaging visuals that move beyond simple PowerPoint slide shows.
