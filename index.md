<b>Summary:</b> Talk given in 2015 to paint the architectural vision for a zero-downtime on-premises blue-green deployment environment -- based on Continous Delivery best practices.  This work paved the way for a 10-month project that incrementally transformed this vision into a reality for Curriculum Pathways.

<b>Summary:</b> "Pitch deck" for my very first "Dolphin Tank" product idea.  This idea was never pursued + served as a great learning experience.  

I continued to pitch innovative product ideas in this forum and eventually became the first developer to have an idea incorporated into an actual product used by Curriculum Pathways team members.

</div>    

<b>Summary:</b> Presented at the District 37 Toastmasters Leadership Institute conference.  Audience members were all VP's and talented speakers at their own clubs. 

To help draw on their expertise, particpants were split into groups focused on one of the main Keys to Club Success. After writing down their best ideas on a large white poster board, each group had 2 minutes to share their discoveries with the rest of the class.

<b>Summary:</b> The Icebreaker is the first talk a member gives when they join a new Toastmasters club. This speech allowed the club learn more about me. It also set the foundation for my ongoing interest in capturing audiences with not only great content but stunning visuals.

This Prezi template was inspired by the Facebook profile page.

<b>Summary:</b> Talk encouraging SoftTalk Toastmasters to signup and participate in a SAS volunteer led [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us).  After watching, several viewers accepted my challenge to help bridge the gap. To this day, several still remain active volunteers.

[How to Say It: Super Green Egg Cups](https://prezi.com/view/FlFa7QiHCkqoku3xkWUf)

</div>  
<b>Summary:</b> The objective of this speech was to use vivid descriptive words that allow the audience to "see" the selected topic come to life in their minds. Recreating this recipe with my added "tasty tips" certainly accomplished that! Audience members wanted to taste these egg cups that I still prepare at times for breakfast.

[Beyond the Inbox: Strategies for Effective Collaboration](https://prezi.com/view/F6KQYjJfTUaPwZLPzcor)

<b>Summary:</b> This workshop was presented to members of the [NC Project Managemenent Institute](https://ncpmi.org/). It was delivered as a brainstorming session similar to the Toastmaster's Leadership conference talk shared above.  

During the workshop, John and I challenged project leaders to embrace simple yet effective habits that reduce cognitive load and increase team effectiveness.

### Mindmaps
Mindmapping products like [Mindmeister](https://mindmeister.com) provide another dimension for a anyone to create, present and share ideas.  

I often use them to help with book reviews, training materials, meeting agendas, and organizing my thoughts around a topic.  The best part of this product is that it also can be exported to a traditional slide show; allowing it to be used to augment the creative process all speakers use when devising new content.
