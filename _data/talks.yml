      Presented at the District 37 Toastmasters Leadership Institute conference.  
      Audience members were all VP's and talented speakers at their own clubs. 
      
      To help draw on their expertise, particpants were split into groups focused on 
      one of the main Keys to Club Success. 
      After writing down their best ideas on a large white poster board, each group 
      had 2 minutes to share their discoveries with the rest of the class.

      The very first talk I gave as a member of Toastmasters. It set the foundation 
      for my interest in using tools like Prezi that allow a speaker to create 
      engaging visuals that move beyond simple PowerPoint slide shows.
